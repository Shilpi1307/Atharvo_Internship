# Atharvo Internship Final Project
## Project Title
Predicting Student Course Dropout Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description
This project was developed as part of my final internship task at Atharvo, where I gained extensive knowledge in various machine learning algorithms. 
<br>The goal of the project is to predict when a student might leave a course and identify potential reasons for dropout using a dataset from the education sector.
<br>
I implemented several machine learning algorithms to solve this problem, including:

1.Logistic Regression<br>
2.Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>
3.Random Forest<br>
4.Gradient Boosting<br>
5.CatBoost<br>
6.Xgboost<br>
